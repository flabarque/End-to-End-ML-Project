# End-to-End-ML-Project

**End-to-End Machine Learning Project** - Chapter II - "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (2nd Edition)" by Aurélien Géron

In this chapter the authors worked through a fictitious example, to illustrate the main steps of a Machine Learning project.

We will use the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. The original dataset appeared in Pace & Barry (1997): "Sparse Spatial Autoregressions", Statistics & Probability Letters 33(3): 291--297.

**Metrics**:

* longitude
* latitude
* housing_median_age
* total_rooms
* total_bedrooms
* population
* households
* median_income
* median_house_value
* ocean_proximity

**Model Prediction**:

Median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.
